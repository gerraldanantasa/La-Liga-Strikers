# LaLiga Strikers: Finding the Best Performers

## Overview

This project provides an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of La Ligaâ€™s top strikers during the 2023-24 season. By analyzing key performance metrics like **Goals per 90**, **Expected Goals (xG)**, **Shot Conversion Rate**, and **Goal Conversion Rate per 90**, the analysis identifies players who are excelling beyond expectations, those underperforming, and players who are statistical anomalies. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into goal-scoring efficiencies and help better understand player performances in La Liga.

The dataset used in this project is from the **La Liga 2023/24 Player and Team Insights** dataset, available on Kaggle. It includes performance metrics for top La Liga players and teams, offering detailed insights into their goal-scoring abilities and other key football statistics.

Additionally, an article summarizing the findings of this analysis is available on **Medium**: [LaLiga Strikers: Finding the Best Performers](https://medium.com/@anantasagerrald/laliga-strikers-finding-the-best-performers-f315e7a07fb7).

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Goals per 90**: Goals scored per 90 minutes played.
- **Expected Goals (xG)**: A measure of the quality of a player's scoring opportunities.
- **Shot Conversion Rate**: The percentage of shots converted into goals.
- **Goal Conversion Rate per 90**: The number of goals scored per 90 minutes relative to the number of opportunities.
  
### Performance Categories:

- **Elite Strikers**: Players who consistently score goals beyond expectations.
- **Potential Breakout**: Players with high potential but need improvement in their conversion or chance creation.
- **Underperformers**: Players who fail to meet the goal expectations based on their xG.

## Findings

- **Top Performers**: Players like **Cristian Stuani**, **Robert Lewandowski**, and **Artem Dovbyk** have consistently outperformed their expected goals (xG), showcasing remarkable goal-scoring efficiency.
- **Underperformers**: Players like **Memphis Depay** and **Cristian Stuani** showed a discrepancy between their expected goals and actual goals scored. However, **Jude Bellingham**'s case stands out, as his goal-scoring stats are impressive given his role as a midfielder.
- **Jude Bellingham**: Bellingham is a statistical anomaly, performing well in shot conversion despite not being a traditional striker. His impressive goal conversion rate reveals that midfielders too can shine in front of goal.

## Insights & Recommendations

- Focus on **improving shot accuracy** for players who are underperforming to meet their expected goals (xG).
- Leverage the **goal-scoring efficiency** of players like **Jude Bellingham**, who, although not a striker, shows potential with an excellent conversion rate.
- Consider developing **position-specific performance metrics** to evaluate players in non-striker roles more effectively.

## Conclusion

This statistical analysis sheds light on the goal-scoring performances of La Liga's top attacking players. Some players exceed their expected goals (xG), while others fall short, highlighting the importance of evaluating players with multiple metrics beyond just goals scored. The **Jude Bellingham** case emphasizes how traditional goal-scoring metrics may not fully represent the value of non-striker players, who contribute in different ways on the field.

By understanding the nuances of performance, teams can better assess talent, develop strategic training programs, and refine their recruitment processes.
